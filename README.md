# Languages

Trying stuff in node, python, java, haskell, bash. Maybe I'll add more later. It tests everything based on the contents of the "expected" file.

## Usage

To run tests:
```
node test.js
```

To create a new folder
```
./create.sh MY_NEW_FOLDER
```

## Tests

Just a brainstorm of tests I could do.
